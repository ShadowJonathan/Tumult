# Tumult - A Tumblr archive(r)

**Tumult is a set of IPLD CBOR specifications, and some tools to help generate them.**

Tumult is supposed to save the majority of Tumblr content into multiple classes, all indexed into a tree;

 - Media content
 - Post content (also conflicted versions thereof)
 - Post metadata
 - Blog metadata
 - Last-seen note count
 
All of these objects are published on the IPFS/Libp2p network as IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data) objects.
